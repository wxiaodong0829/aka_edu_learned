Ah love! Could you and I with Fate conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things Entire,
Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire.

The life that I have is all that I have,
The life that I have is yours.
The love that I have of the life that I have,
Is yours, and yours, and yours.

The sleep I shall have, the rest I shall have,
Yet death will be, but a pause.
For the years of my life in the long green grass,
Will be yours, and yours, and yours.
