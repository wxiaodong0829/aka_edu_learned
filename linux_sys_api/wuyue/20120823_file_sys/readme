1, 回顾
	
	概念：1，文件三个时间
		  2，unlink删除目录项
		  3，重定向
		  4，文件系统自荐测
							inotify机制  
							链表，手动对比
	
	函数：
		1，stat()  fstat()  lstat()
		2, unlink() 删目录项
		3, access() 
		4，dup dup2
		5, opendir() closedir() readdir()
		6, inotify 函数族



2, inotify 继续做，把所有标志都加上，测试用vim修改文件，vim到底对文件做了什么.

$vi out
	wd:1 teach file was opened
	wd:1 teach file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out access read
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out access read
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 4913 file/directory created in watched directory
	wd:1 4913 file was opened
	wd:1 4913 metadata changed
	wd:1 4913 file opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 4913 file/directory deleted from watched directory
	wd:1 out file moved out of watched directory
	wd:1 out~ file moved into watched directory
	wd:1 out file/directory created in watched directory
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out file was modified
	wd:1 out file opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out metadata changed
	wd:1 out~ file/directory deleted from watched directory
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out access read
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed
	wd:1 out file was opened
	wd:1 out access read
	wd:1 out file not opened for writing was closed



3, 统计一个目录下的普通文件个数，遇到目录，进入，累加旗下的普通文件个数.
